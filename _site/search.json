Navigate to ‘Find Data > Search by Theme > Population > Geographic Distribution > Latest Data’ under Population Trends or use the linkhttps://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data to directly go to the page.\nThis data is used to find the demographic structure of Singapore at planning level by using age-sex pyramid method in trellis display style. Out of all the available planning level areas in the data set, I have decided to choose these 9 areas for trellis style display - ‘Ang Mo Kio’, ‘Bedok’, ‘Chao Chu Kang’, ‘Jurong West’, ‘Pungol’, ‘Sengkang’, ‘Tampines’, ‘Woodlands’, ‘Yishun’."

Legend can be removed to give more space for pyramid which can make it more clear.\n\n\nRow and Column Heading\nThe age-sex pyramid have extra row and column heading which contains serial number. It can be removed as it is not relevant to the visualization.\n\n\nColor Selection\nColor selection for the Males and Females are a bit off. It can be changed to more brighter color to make it more attractive to eyes.\n\n\nData Table\nAs a good visualization practice, details should be on-demand.
