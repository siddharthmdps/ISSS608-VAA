Navigate to ‘Find Data > Search by Theme > Population > Geographic Distribution > Latest Data’ under Population Trends or use the linkhttps://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data to directly go to the page.\nThis data is used to find the demographic structure of Singapore at planning level by using age-sex pyramid method in trellis display style. Out of all the available planning level areas in the data set, I have decided to choose these 9 areas for trellis style display - ‘Ang Mo Kio’, ‘Bedok’, ‘Chao Chu Kang’, ‘Jurong West’, ‘Pungol’, ‘Sengkang’, ‘Tampines’, ‘Woodlands’, ‘Yishun’."
